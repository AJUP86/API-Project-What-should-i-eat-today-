# API Project What should i eat today

A single page website that helps you decide what to eat.

Description : **"What should i eat today "** will help humans in a rush to **decide for them what they will eat** (because the is no time available for meal planning) . The site will give to the humans a list of **20 recipes per query**, the human can search an **ingredient**, a specific **cuisine**, an actual dish and also can **ask in english or spanish(maybe dutch)**. Inside each recipe is a **button** that takes you to a foreign website to get the full detailed recipe.

I hope you enjoy the experience!
